# Design Patterns Implementation Repository

This repository contains practical implementations of various design patterns. Each folder corresponds to a specific design pattern, demonstrating its structure, usage, and benefits. The following design patterns are covered:

## Creational Patterns
- **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to produce different representations.
- **Factory**: Provides an interface for creating an object, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Prototype**: Lets you copy already existing objects without making the code dependent on their classes.
- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a point of access to this instance.

## Structural Patterns
- **Adapter**: Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together.
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
- **Decorator**: Adds new functionalities to an object dynamically.
- **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a library, framework, or set of classes.
- **Flyweight**: Reduces the number of objects created by sharing objects that are similar.
- **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

## Behavioral Patterns
- **Chain of Responsibility**: Allows an object to pass the request along the chain of potential handlers until an object handles it.
- **Command**: Converts requests or simple operations into objects.
- **Memento**: Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state.
- **Observer**: Lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object they're observing.
- **State**: Allows an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.
- **Strategy**: Allows selecting an algorithm's implementation at runtime.
- **Template Method**: Defines the program skeleton of an algorithm in an algorithm class but delays some steps to subclasses.
- **Singleton Factory Combo**: A combination of Singleton and Factory patterns.

Thank you for exploring this repository! Feel free to delve into each pattern to see its implementation and understand its use cases.
